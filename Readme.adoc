= Fanorona with Min-Max AI built in Python

Created as a school project with Python 3.6 and Tkinter.

The code is in no means clean or even any good. It was my first ever programming project and I used it to learn basic concepts back in 2018/19.
My original Version Control was lots of copies of the project folder, so I decided to put all those together into this repository.

== What is Fanorona?

It's a Board Game from Madagascar, chosen for the project because of it's relative simplicity compared to other board games like Chess, without being quite as simple as Tick-Tack-Toe.
